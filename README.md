## Getting started

Prior to running, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the website.

## Future implementations

For future implementations, I would have liked to add a search feature to filter through the events, and I would have also liked to make individual pages for each event, but I couldn't think of an easy way to do this. I would have also liked to use Docker and Sass + BEM methodologies, but I wanted to complete the test in time and therefore wasn't able to spend the time learning the technologies.
